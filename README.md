# HemeSens

HemeSens is a mobile application designed especially for elderly users. It helps users record blood sugar measurements with date and time in an easy and clear way.

## Purpose of the Project

Many elderly people have difficulty remembering or writing down their blood sugar values. HemeSens solves this problem by saving measurement data digitally.

## How It Works

- The user measures blood sugar with a glucose device
- The measured value is detected by the application
- The app saves:
 - Blood sugar value
 - Measurement date
 - Measurement time
- All records can be viewed day by day
